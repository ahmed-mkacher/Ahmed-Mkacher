Oh, hello there :)
Welcome here! You are probably on the wrong page, but... you may also like to have a look.

So, that's my name and about myself.... Yeaaaah, I don't have much to say for now.
I am a freshman 1st year student at ESPRIT in Tunisia.
Currently I am doing CS50X, 100 days of code in Python and taking the "Become a software developer" curriculum on LinkedIn Learning.
The last few years of my life probably have been a waste when it comes to achievements...
I've been just playing lots of video games... and that's it

I am trying to make up for all of that time this year though, as much as I can.
So wish me luck!
